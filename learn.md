# Understanding

## Overview of AI Concepts

- **Traditional AI:**  
    - Focuses on identifying patterns in data and making predictions about future events.  
    - Example: Predicting stock prices, detecting spam emails.

- **Generative AI:**  
    - Focuses on creating new content, such as generating Kubernetes manifests or writing Dockerfiles.  
    - Example: Generating text, images, or code based on prompts.

#### Use Cases

- **Traditional AI:**
    - Fraud detection in banking
    - Spam email filtering
    - Predictive maintenance
    - Recommendation systems

- **Generative AI:**
    - Generating text (e.g., articles, summaries)
    - Creating images or art
    - Writing code snippets or configuration files
    - Producing synthetic data for training

#### Key Differences

| Aspect                | Traditional AI                          | Generative AI                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Primary Function      | Pattern recognition & prediction        | Content creation & generation              |
| Output                | Labels, predictions, classifications    | Text, images, code, audio, etc.            |
| Example Applications  | Fraud detection, recommendations        | Text generation, image synthesis           |
| Data Usage            | Analyzes existing data                  | Learns to create new data                  |
| Typical Algorithms    | Decision trees, SVM, regression         | Transformers, GANs, diffusion models       |

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

- LLMs are trained on massive datasets (billions or trillions of data points).
- When you ask a question, LLMs respond quickly by retrieving information from their training data.
- Approximately 80% of their data comes from web crawling.

### Key Terminology

- **Prompt:**  
    An input or instruction given to an AI model to generate a response.

### Types of AI Tools

- **AI Chatbots:**  
    - Examples: ChatGPT, Claude  
    - Used for conversational interactions.

- **AI Agents & Assistants:**  
    - Example: GitHub Copilot  
    - Used for assisting with tasks like code completion and suggestions.

### Programming Focus Areas

- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
    - Python  
    - FastAPI

These are the main areas to focus on for understanding and working with AI and generative models.
